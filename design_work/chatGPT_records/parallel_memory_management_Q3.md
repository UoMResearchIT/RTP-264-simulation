# Question: in python can I adjust max_workers within an executor.map loop

# Answer

In Python, you cannot directly adjust `max_workers` while using `executor.map()` because the `ProcessPoolExecutor` and `ThreadPoolExecutor` are designed to be set up once and used for the duration of their context. Attempting to change the number of workers mid-execution would not have any effect on the already running executor.

However, if you need to adjust the number of workers dynamically, you can consider the following approach:

1. **Chunking Your Tasks**: Split your tasks into smaller batches and create a new executor for each batch, allowing you to adjust `max_workers` based on conditions before processing the next batch.

2. **Managing Execution with Custom Logic**: Use a loop to process chunks of tasks, creating a new executor for each chunk.

Hereâ€™s an example to demonstrate this approach:

### Example Code

```python
import concurrent.futures
import psutil
import os
import time

# Example task function
def process_task(data):
    time.sleep(1)  # Simulate some processing time
    return data ** 2  # Example operation

def get_max_workers():
    memory_info = psutil.virtual_memory()
    available_memory = memory_info.available  # Available memory in bytes

    if available_memory > 2 * 1024**3:  # More than 2 GB available
        return os.cpu_count()  # Use all CPU cores
    elif available_memory > 1 * 1024**3:  # More than 1 GB available
        return os.cpu_count() // 2  # Use half of the CPU cores
    else:
        return 1  # Fallback to 1 worker if memory is low

def main(data_list, chunk_size):
    results = []

    # Process data in chunks
    for i in range(0, len(data_list), chunk_size):
        chunk = data_list[i:i + chunk_size]
        max_workers = get_max_workers()  # Adjust max_workers for the current chunk

        with concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor(max_workers=max_workers) as executor:
            # Map the function to the data
            for result in executor.map(process_task, chunk):
                results.append(result)

    return results

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Sample data
    data = list(range(100))  # Example data
    processed_data = main(data, chunk_size=10)
    print(processed_data)
```

### Explanation

1. **Chunk Processing**:
   - The `main` function processes data in chunks defined by `chunk_size`.
   - For each chunk, it retrieves the current available memory and adjusts `max_workers`.

2. **New Executor for Each Chunk**:
   - A new `ProcessPoolExecutor` is created for each chunk, allowing you to set `max_workers` based on the memory conditions.

3. **Flexibility**:
   - This approach gives you the flexibility to adjust the number of workers based on the memory available at each step of processing.

### Considerations

- **Performance Overhead**: Creating a new executor for each chunk introduces some overhead, so choose your chunk size wisely to balance between memory management and performance.
- **Error Handling**: Implement error handling as needed, especially when dealing with large data sets and external resources.
