# Question: in python write a function using psutil library to pause a file load until there is enough spare RAM

# Answer

To create a function that pauses a file load until there is enough spare RAM using the `psutil` library, you can follow these steps:

1. **Check Available Memory**: Use `psutil.virtual_memory()` to monitor the available RAM.
2. **Define a Threshold**: Set a threshold for the minimum amount of free RAM required before proceeding with the file load.
3. **Pause Execution**: If the available memory is below the threshold, the function should pause until enough memory is available.

Hereâ€™s an example implementation:

### Example Code

```python
import psutil
import time

def wait_for_memory(threshold_mb):
    """
    Wait until there is enough spare RAM available.

    :param threshold_mb: Minimum spare RAM required in megabytes.
    """
    threshold_bytes = threshold_mb * 1024 * 1024  # Convert MB to bytes

    while True:
        # Get the available memory
        memory_info = psutil.virtual_memory()
        available_memory = memory_info.available  # Available memory in bytes
        
        if available_memory >= threshold_bytes:
            print(f"Sufficient memory available: {available_memory / (1024 * 1024):.2f} MB")
            break  # Exit the loop when enough memory is available
        else:
            print(f"Not enough memory. Available: {available_memory / (1024 * 1024):.2f} MB. Waiting...")
            time.sleep(5)  # Wait before checking again

def load_file(file_path):
    """
    Load a file after ensuring enough memory is available.
    
    :param file_path: Path to the file to be loaded.
    """
    print(f"Checking memory before loading {file_path}...")
    wait_for_memory(threshold_mb=100)  # Set threshold to 100 MB
    print(f"Loading file: {file_path}")
    # Simulate file loading
    with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
        data = f.read()
    print(f"File {file_path} loaded successfully.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Example usage: replace 'example.txt' with the path to your file
    load_file('example.txt')
```

### Explanation

1. **`wait_for_memory` Function**:
   - This function continuously checks the available RAM using `psutil.virtual_memory()`.
   - It converts the threshold from megabytes to bytes for comparison.
   - If the available memory is less than the threshold, it prints a message and sleeps for 5 seconds before checking again.

2. **`load_file` Function**:
   - Before attempting to load the file, this function calls `wait_for_memory` with a specified threshold (e.g., 100 MB).
   - Once enough memory is available, it proceeds to load the file.

3. **Example Usage**:
   - You can replace `'example.txt'` with the path to the file you want to load.

### Considerations

- **Threshold Value**: Adjust the `threshold_mb` value based on your application's memory requirements.
- **Error Handling**: Consider adding error handling for file operations to manage cases where the file might not exist or cannot be opened.
- **Infinite Loop**: The current implementation will loop indefinitely if memory never becomes available; you might want to add a maximum wait time or exit condition based on your application's needs.
