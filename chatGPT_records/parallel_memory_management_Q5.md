# Question: in python check for existence of data within a shared memory array, if it doesn't exist then wait for it to be created

# Answer

To check for the existence of data within a shared memory array in Python and wait for it to be created, you can use a combination of shared memory, locks for synchronization, and condition variables for efficient waiting.

### Example Code

Here's how you can implement this:

```python
import concurrent.futures
import multiprocessing
import time

def process_task(shared_data, index, condition):
    # Simulate some processing
    time.sleep(index)  # Different sleep times for demonstration

    # Create some data in the shared array
    with condition:
        shared_data[index] = index * 2  # Example operation
        condition.notify_all()  # Notify waiting processes

def check_for_data(shared_data, index, condition):
    with condition:
        while shared_data[index] is None:  # Wait until data is created
            condition.wait()  # Wait for notification

def main(data_list):
    # Create a shared array initialized with None
    shared_data = multiprocessing.Array('i', [None] * len(data_list))  # 'i' for integers
    condition = multiprocessing.Condition()  # Condition for synchronization

    with concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor() as executor:
        # Start processing tasks
        futures = [executor.submit(process_task, shared_data, i, condition) for i in range(len(data_list))]

        # Check for data existence
        for i in range(len(shared_data)):
            executor.submit(check_for_data, shared_data, i, condition)

        # Wait for all tasks to complete
        for future in concurrent.futures.as_completed(futures):
            future.result()  # This will also raise exceptions if any

    # Convert shared array back to a list
    results = list(shared_data)
    print(results)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    data = list(range(10))  # Sample data
    main(data)
```

### Explanation

1. **Shared Array Initialization**:
   - We create a shared array using `multiprocessing.Array`, initialized with `None` to indicate that no data has been created yet.

2. **Condition Variable**:
   - We use `multiprocessing.Condition()` to allow threads to wait for a certain condition to be met (in this case, the existence of data in the shared array).

3. **Processing Task**:
   - The `process_task` function simulates some processing time and then sets a value in the shared array. After setting the value, it calls `condition.notify_all()` to wake up any waiting processes.

4. **Checking for Data**:
   - The `check_for_data` function checks if the specified index in the shared array is `None`. If it is, it waits on the condition variable until it is notified that the data has been created.

5. **Execution**:
   - We start processing tasks and simultaneously check for the existence of data for each index in the shared array.

### Considerations

- **Blocking**: The `check_for_data` function blocks until the data is available, which can be useful for ensuring that the main logic waits for necessary conditions.
- **Error Handling**: Consider adding error handling for potential exceptions during task execution.
- **Efficiency**: This design allows for efficient waiting without busy waiting, reducing CPU usage.

This approach allows you to effectively manage data creation and synchronization among multiple processes using shared memory in Python.
