# Question: in python multiprocessing library how do I wait for a specific notify message


# Answer

To wait for a specific notify message in Python's `multiprocessing` library, you can use a combination of `Condition` objects and a shared variable to indicate which specific message or event has occurred. Below is a step-by-step explanation and example code to illustrate how to implement this.

### Step-by-Step Approach

1. **Use a Shared Variable**: Create a shared variable (like a `multiprocessing.Value` or a `multiprocessing.Array`) to store the current state or message.

2. **Condition Variable**: Use a `Condition` object to manage waiting and notifying between processes.

3. **Notify Specific Message**: In the worker processes, change the shared variable and notify the condition when the specific event occurs.

4. **Wait for the Specific Message**: In the waiting process, check the shared variable and wait on the condition until the specific message is received.

### Example Code

Here's an example that demonstrates this approach:

```python
import multiprocessing
import time

def worker(shared_message, condition, target_message):
    # Simulate some processing
    time.sleep(2)  # Simulate work being done
    # Set the shared message to the target message
    with condition:
        shared_message.value = target_message
        condition.notify_all()  # Notify all waiting processes

def wait_for_message(shared_message, condition, expected_message):
    with condition:
        while shared_message.value != expected_message:  # Wait for specific message
            condition.wait()  # Wait until notified
    print(f"Received the expected message: {expected_message}")

def main():
    # Shared variable for message
    shared_message = multiprocessing.Value('i', 0)  # 'i' for integer
    condition = multiprocessing.Condition()

    # Create worker processes
    target_message = 42
    process = multiprocessing.Process(target=worker, args=(shared_message, condition, target_message))
    process.start()

    # Wait for a specific message
    wait_for_message(shared_message, condition, target_message)

    # Clean up
    process.join()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation

1. **Shared Variable**:
   - A shared variable `shared_message` is created using `multiprocessing.Value`. This will hold the message sent by the worker.

2. **Condition Object**:
   - A `Condition` object is created to allow processes to wait for notifications.

3. **Worker Function**:
   - The `worker` function simulates some processing, then sets the `shared_message` to a target message (in this case, `42`) and calls `condition.notify_all()` to wake up any waiting processes.

4. **Waiting Function**:
   - The `wait_for_message` function checks if the `shared_message` matches the expected message. If not, it calls `condition.wait()` to block until it is notified.

5. **Execution**:
   - The main function creates the worker process, starts it, and then waits for the specific message. Once the message is received, it prints it out.

### Considerations

- **Blocking**: The waiting function blocks until the specific message is received, which is efficient and avoids busy waiting.
- **Multiple Workers**: If you have multiple workers and need to wait for multiple specific messages, you can adapt this structure accordingly (e.g., using different shared variables or using a list).
- **Error Handling**: Consider adding error handling, especially for process management and communication. 

This approach effectively allows you to wait for a specific notify message in a multiprocessing context in Python.
