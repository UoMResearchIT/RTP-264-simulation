# Question: how can I use psutil library in python to track memory usage and adjust max_workers

# Answer

You can use the `psutil` library to monitor memory usage in your Python application and dynamically adjust the `max_workers` for your `ProcessPoolExecutor` based on the current memory usage. Here’s how you can implement this:

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Install `psutil`**: If you haven’t already, you can install it using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install psutil
   ```

2. **Monitor Memory Usage**: Use `psutil.virtual_memory()` to check the available memory and adjust `max_workers` accordingly.

3. **Dynamic Adjustment of `max_workers`**: Before starting the tasks, you can define a function that checks memory usage and sets `max_workers` based on the available memory.

### Example Code

Here's an example that illustrates how to implement this:

```python
import concurrent.futures
import psutil
import os
import time

# Example task function
def process_task(data):
    time.sleep(1)  # Simulate some processing time
    return data ** 2  # Example operation

def get_max_workers():
    # Get available memory
    memory_info = psutil.virtual_memory()
    available_memory = memory_info.available  # Available memory in bytes

    # Define memory thresholds and corresponding worker limits
    if available_memory > 2 * 1024**3:  # More than 2 GB available
        return os.cpu_count()  # Use all CPU cores
    elif available_memory > 1 * 1024**3:  # More than 1 GB available
        return os.cpu_count() // 2  # Use half of the CPU cores
    else:
        return 1  # Fallback to 1 worker if memory is low

def main(data_list):
    max_workers = get_max_workers()  # Dynamically set max_workers
    results = []

    with concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor(max_workers=max_workers) as executor:
        # Map the function to the data
        for result in executor.map(process_task, data_list):
            results.append(result)

    return results

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Sample data
    data = list(range(100))  # Example data
    processed_data = main(data)
    print(processed_data)
```

### Explanation

1. **Dynamic Worker Adjustment**:
   - The `get_max_workers` function checks the available system memory using `psutil.virtual_memory()`.
   - It sets `max_workers` based on predefined thresholds for available memory:
     - More than 2 GB: use all CPU cores.
     - More than 1 GB: use half the CPU cores.
     - Less than 1 GB: use only 1 worker.

2. **Task Execution**:
   - The `main` function calls `get_max_workers` to determine how many workers to use before starting the `ProcessPoolExecutor`.

3. **Memory Monitoring**:
   - This approach ensures that your application adjusts the number of parallel processes based on real-time memory availability, helping to prevent memory overload.

### Additional Considerations

- **Further Adjustments**: You can modify the thresholds and worker limits based on your specific use case and system capabilities.
- **Error Handling**: Implement error handling to manage any unexpected behavior, especially when working with memory-intensive tasks.
- **Testing**: Test your implementation under different system loads to find the optimal configuration for your tasks.
